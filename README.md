# Overview

## Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a classic example of a cellular automaton, where cells in a grid evolve through generations based on simple rules. The simulation demonstrates how complex patterns and behaviors can emerge from these rules.

## Sand Simulation

The Sand Simulation visualizes the behavior of sand particles falling and settling into a grid. The simulation is a fun way to explore particle dynamics and basic physics in a 2D space.

## Langton's Ant
